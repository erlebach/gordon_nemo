Would you like a small wrapper that can truncate layers *at load time* while still preserving the rest of the checkpoint structure?<br>

<i>[6/3/2025, 1:47:46 PM]</i> 👉 <b>👤 User</b>: Yes please.<br>
<i>[6/3/2025, 1:47:48 PM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: 

Here is a robust wrapper that allows you to **truncate a pretrained NeMo model** (e.g., LLaMA or GPT-style) at load time, while still **loading weights from a full checkpoint**.

This works for experimentation and fast iteration — you get the tokenizer, embeddings, and optionally the top or bottom `k` layers.

---

## ✅ Use Case
- Load full `.nemo` checkpoint (e.g., LLaMA3-8B).
- Retain only a **subset of transformer layers**.
- Allow `strict=False` so loading does not fail due to missing layers.

---

## 🧩 Code: `load_and_truncate_model.py`

```python
from nemo.collections.nlp.models.language_modeling.megatron_gpt_model import MegatronGPTModel
from omegaconf import OmegaConf
import torch.nn as nn

def truncate_layers(model: MegatronGPTModel, keep_last_n: int = 4):
    """
    Replace the transformer layer stack with only the top `n` layers.
    Adjust this for bottom-N or custom slicing.
    """
    full_layers = model.model.language_model.encoder.layers
    total_layers = len(full_layers)

    # Slice the layers: keep only last N
    kept_layers = full_layers[-keep_last_n:]
    print(f"Keeping {keep_last_n} of {total_layers} transformer layers.")

    # Reassign the layers
    model.model.language_model.encoder.layers = nn.ModuleList(kept_layers)
    model.model.language_model.encoder.num_layers = keep_last_n

    return model

def load_truncated_model(nemo_path: str, keep_last_n: int = 4) -> MegatronGPTModel:
    # Load config first, then model with strict=False
    cfg = MegatronGPTModel.restore_from(nemo_path, return_config=True)
    model = MegatronGPTModel.restore_from(nemo_path, cfg=cfg, strict=False)

    # Modify architecture in place
    model = truncate_layers(model, keep_last_n=keep_last_n)
    return model

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    model_path = "/workspace/results/lora_finetune/checkpoints/megatron_gpt.nemo"
    model = load_truncated_model(model_path, keep_last_n=4)
```

---

## 🛠 Notes

- Uses `strict=False` to permit partial matching between model structure and saved weights.
- Works best with **top-down transformers** (GPT, LLaMA) — assumes a layer stack at `model.model.language_model.encoder.layers`.
- You may also slice `full_layers[:keep_n]` to retain **early layers** instead of the last ones.

---

## ⚠️ Compatibility Tips

- Ensure other attributes like `encoder.num_layers` are updated to avoid inconsistencies.
- Works best when training script **does not regenerate model from config**, i.e., you're operating on the loaded model directly.

Would you like a modified `finetune_recipe(...)` variant that automatically injects this truncation logic as a wrapper step inside a `run.Experiment`?<br>

<i>[6/3/2025, 2:57:58 PM]</i> 👉 <b>👤 User</b>: Is it possible to easily covert a recipe to a yaml file?<br>
<i>[6/3/2025, 2:57:59 PM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: 

Yes — it is possible (and quite useful) to **convert a `finetune_recipe(...)` object to a YAML file** for inspection, manual editing, or reproducibility.

Since NeMo 2.0 recipes are **OmegaConf-based configs**, you can do this in one line:

---

## ✅ Save a Recipe to YAML

```python
from omegaconf import OmegaConf

recipe = llm.llama3_8b.finetune_recipe(...)  # your configured recipe
OmegaConf.save(config=recipe, f="llama3_peft_config.yaml")
```

This writes a full `llama3_peft_config.yaml` to disk — compatible with any Hydra-based script or for future reloading.

---

## 🧾 Bonus: Load a YAML as Config

Later, you can load it back and pass it to a model:

```python
cfg = OmegaConf.load("llama3_peft_config.yaml")
model = MegatronGPTModel(cfg.model, trainer=setup_trainer(cfg.trainer))
```

You can also feed it to `hydra_runner()` in legacy training scripts.

---

## 📦 Where This Helps

- Comparing PEFT vs Full FT configs.
- Hand-editing parameters like learning rate, number of layers, adapter dimensions.
- Reusing exact runs in another context (e.g., manual `torchrun`).

Would you like me to give you a short CLI utility to convert any recipe to YAML interactively?<br>

<i>[6/3/2025, 2:59:22 PM]</i> 👉 <b>👤 User</b>: Do I need the guy to translate from recipe to yaml?  Or can I do this on the front end or Mac?<br>
<i>[6/3/2025, 2:59:23 PM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: 

You do **not need the GPU** (or any special backend) to convert a **NeMo recipe to a YAML file** — you can absolutely do this on your **Mac or other front end**. The recipe is just a Python object built from configuration code.

---

## ✅ Minimal Requirements

To generate and save a recipe to YAML on your Mac:

### You need:
- Python ≥3.8
- `nemo-toolkit` or just `nemo_launcher`
- `omegaconf` (dependency of NeMo)

### You **do not** need:
- CUDA
- GPUs
- `nemo_run` execution

---

## ✅ Example Script (Run on Mac)
```python
from nemo_launcher.utils.llm import llm
from omegaconf import OmegaConf

# Generate PEFT recipe (no GPU required)
recipe = llm.llama3_8b.finetune_recipe(
    dir="./debug_peft",
    name="llama3_peft_debug",
    num_nodes=1,
    num_gpus_per_node=1,
    peft_scheme="lora"
)

# Save to YAML
OmegaConf.save(config=recipe, f="llama3_peft_debug.yaml")
print("Saved to llama3_peft_debug.yaml")
```

---

## 🔧 To Set Up on Mac

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install nemo-launcher
```

Or if you already use `uv`:
```bash
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install nemo-launcher
```

---

Let me know if you want a CLI tool like:

```bash
python recipe_to_yaml.py --model llama3_8b --peft lora --outfile config.yaml
```

which would allow easy generation from the terminal.<br>

<i>[6/3/2025, 2:59:56 PM]</i> 👉 <b>👤 User</b>: So this is a great way to compare models efficiently.<br>
<i>[6/3/2025, 2:59:56 PM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: 

Exactly — **converting recipes to YAML is one of the best ways to compare models efficiently and transparently**. Here’s why:

---

## ✅ Why YAML Conversion Helps

### 🔍 1. **Side-by-side comparison**
- You can diff PEFT vs full fine-tuning recipes directly:
  ```bash
  diff llama3_peft.yaml llama3_full.yaml
  ```

### 🧠 2. **Understand defaults**
- You see **all hidden defaults** set by `finetune_recipe(...)`, including:
  - optimizer type,
  - scheduler settings,
  - dropout,
  - layer counts,
  - frozen parameters,
  - precision.

### 🧪 3. **Trace subtle differences**
- Small but critical changes like:
  - `peft_scheme: lora` → `None`
  - `restore_from_path: ...`
  - `num_gpus_per_node: 1` → `2`

are immediately visible.

### 🛠 4. **Edit and replay runs**
- You can tweak learning rate, adapter size, number of steps directly in YAML.
- Load them back with:
  ```python
  cfg = OmegaConf.load("llama3_custom.yaml")
  ```

### 📦 5. **Version control / Reproducibility**
- Keep YAML configs under Git for reproducible experiment tracking.

‘run.LocalExecutor’ appears to be executed twice. Once as a task in the experiment t, and once near the top of the enclosing function.<br>

<i>[6/3/2025, 3:10:14 PM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: 

You're absolutely right to notice that — let's clarify what's happening.

---

## 🔍 The Two Uses of `run.LocalExecutor`

### 🔹 **First Use (top of `run_finetuning`)**
```python
executor = local_executor_torchrun(...)
```
- This sets up the **main executor** for the **PEFT fine-tuning task**.
- It configures `torchrun` as the launcher and sets environment variables like `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, `HF_TOKEN_PATH`, etc.

✅ This executor is used for distributed training and heavy GPU work.

---

### 🔹 **Second Use (inside the experiment block)**
```python
exp.add(import_ckpt, executor=run.LocalExecutor(), name="import_from_hf")
```
- This creates a **plain, one-off LocalExecutor** (default settings, no GPU, no `torchrun`) just for the `import_ckpt` step — converting a HuggingFace checkpoint.
- This step is lightweight — no distributed training needed.

✅ This is intentional: you **don’t want to launch torchrun just to run a simple preprocessing function**.

---

## 🧠 Why They’re Different (and Needed)

| Task                  | Executor Used                   | Why |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|-----|
| `import_ckpt`         | `run.LocalExecutor()` (default) | Just runs Python code, no torchrun, no GPU overhead |
| `peft_finetuning`     | `local_executor_torchrun(...)`  | Launches training via `torchrun` across GPUs         |

You **could reuse** the `torchrun` executor for both, but that would be inefficient and unnecessarily complex for the first task.

---

## ✅ Best Practice

Keep both. The separation:
- improves clarity,
- avoids overspecification (e.g., GPU launching for CPU-only tasks),
- and allows for future staging flexibility (e.g., checkpoint conversion, data preproc, tokenization, etc.).

Let me know if you'd like to wrap this pattern into a general-purpose experiment template.<br>
