<i>[5/26/2025, 8:15:01 PM]</i> üëâ <b>üë§ User</b>: I am using nemo-run (from Nvidia) on a Slurm cluster and find out that the Pyxis plugin is required for nemo-run to function properly. Please investigate and tell me whether this is correct or not. <br>
<i>[5/26/2025, 8:15:02 PM]</i> üëâ <b>ü§ñ Assistant</b>: 

**Short answer**

Yes‚Äîif you use **`nemo-run`** to launch NeMo jobs *as Slurm jobs that run inside an NGC container*, the cluster needs the **Pyxis + Enroot** plugin set. `nemo-run` emits `srun` commands that rely on Pyxis-specific options (e.g. `--container-image`, `--container-mounts`). Without Pyxis those options are unknown to Slurm and the job fails to start.

---

### Why Pyxis is considered ‚Äúrequired‚Äù

| Component | Role | How `nemo-run` depends on it |
|-----------|------|------------------------------|
| **Enroot** | Lightweight, root-less container runtime (unpacks the NGC image) | Supplies the actual file-system and runtime isolation |
| **Pyxis** | Slurm plugin that bridges `srun`/`sbatch` to Enroot (adds `--container-*` flags) | `nemo-run` constructs Slurm launch strings that assume these flags exist |
| **Slurm** | Scheduler / resource manager | Provides GPUs + nodes to the containerised job |

When Pyxis is absent you will see errors such as:

```
srun: error: unrecognized option '--container-image'
```

because vanilla Slurm does not know those options.

---

### How to verify on your cluster

1. **Check the plugins Slurm loaded**

```bash
scontrol show config | grep -i prolog
# or
srun --version      # will list ‚Äúpyxis‚Äù if compiled in
```

2. **Ask the admin** whether the packages `pyxis` and `enroot` are installed (they live under `/opt/slurm-spank` or `/opt/pyxis` on most clusters).

3. **Dry-run `nemo-run`**: it prints the `srun ‚Ä¶ --container-image ‚Ä¶` line before submission; if you copy-paste that line and Slurm immediately rejects it, Pyxis is not in place.

---

### If Pyxis is *not* available

| Option | Trade-offs |
|--------|-----------|
| **Install Pyxis+Enroot** (needs admin) | Easiest, matches NVIDIA examples, keeps job isolation |
| **Run NeMo natively** (pip/conda in the host environment) | Works without Pyxis, but you lose the clean, reproducible container stack and need all CUDA/NCCL/PyTorch libs in the host modules |
| **Use Singularity/Apptainer** (if allowed) | Slurm‚Äôs native `--mpi=pmi2` works with Singularity; you must adapt `nemo-run` scripts or call NeMo‚Äôs training scripts directly |

---

### A glance ahead (‚Äúforward-looking‚Äù)

NVIDIA‚Äôs newer **Fabric Manager‚Äìaware** container orchestration (under development) aims to merge Pyxis‚Äô convenience with better GPU topo-aware scheduling. If that matures, we may see `nemo-run` add a backend that no longer demands the Pyxis SPANK plugin, but today Pyxis remains the officially supported path for Slurm clusters.

---

*In practice: unless your cluster‚Äôs admins purposely expose another container workflow and have patched `nemo-run`, assume Pyxis is a hard prerequisite.*<br>
